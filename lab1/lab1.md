1. Free Distribution - So I guess this just means you can't make money off of Open source software, which makes sense. 
2.Soruce Code - Source code always has to be avaliable, which is also the point. Just gotta make sure there are easy instructions to use it and whatnot. 
3. Derived works - If someone makes your thing better, that should also be free. 
4. Integrity of the Author's Source Code - I suppose this is up to the author. The author may not care otherwise. 
5. Makes sense, but what if you want a racist program? 
6. Can use anything for any purpose. 
7. So anyone who pulls an open source repo gets protected by the same rights it's under? Cool. 
8. Explaining the one above. 
9. Wait, so you can take open source and modify it to make it not open source if the license says so? Or it doesn't, since it shouldn't restrict? Doesn't that violate the stuff above? 
10. makes the project universal.
