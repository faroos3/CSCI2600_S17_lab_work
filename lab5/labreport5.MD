  It says there are 5 authors but it's 3 on the github repo page...
  Gitstats is also saying there are 2606 lines instead of 2601.
  The first and last commit are consistent. You can see the days they worked the most too, this is crazy.

  This says there are 14 contributors. Weird.
  It also  says there are 20,873 lines of code, so 3 lines more.
  The report period for commits is again, consistent.
