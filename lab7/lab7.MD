This is the MD file for lab7.

Our project is coming along. I could not do a whole lot last week as I got sick. My part is to work on the algorithm that will actually
do the difference checking. I have to wait until I actually have the audio files being converted into text first. I can try it on text files I guess,
which is what I'll do while I wait.
